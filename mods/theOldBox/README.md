# The Old Box

[mod.io](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/the-old-box)

Not accustomed to the township boxes in the new version? Opt for the old ones.

They will adhere to the `v1.1.2` behavior, without any quest quantity restrictions, lower unlock requirements, and fixed loot quantities.

- no township tasks requirements
- level requirements restore to 30/15, 90/75, and 115/110
- always obtain the maximum quantity of loot

This mod exclusively alters box behavior, without any alterations to the township.
